#   This script was created to monitor a server that had a habit of filling
#   all it's free space with log and cache files and fail to clear them.
#
#   The report gives you an overview of disk usage, and then spot-checks
#   common log and cache file locations printing out their total size in MB.
#
#   The list is sorted according to folder size, letting you identify folders
#   that fill up to quickly or too often.

# use colors if available
